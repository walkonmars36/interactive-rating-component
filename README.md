## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- ARIA roles
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I'm beginning to focus a lot on accessibility and ensuring (as far as I can) to build accessible pages, both with using semantic markup and the appropriate ARIA roles. This is high on my list at the moment.

### Useful resources

- [The A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) - The home of the a11y (accessibility) project.

- [web.dev intro to ARIA](https://web.dev/semantics-aria/) - Introduction to ARIA from the web.dev Chrome team.

- [a11y coffee project](https://a11y.coffee/) - this is a useful resource too.
